# Minimal-Framework
A simple framework/baseline to get started with writing small apps. I am a beginner and so, I am making this project to get a better understanding of nodejs and javascript.

### Todo
* Create /public folder to store img, js, fonts etc.
* Clean up code and comments
* ~~Link local mongodb database with mongoose, and display api data on front page.~~
