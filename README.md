# Minimal-Skeleton
A simple skeleton/baseline to get started with writing nodejs apps. I am a beginner and so, I am making this project to get a better understanding of nodejs and javascript. Minimal-Skeleton uses node-restful to setup a simple REST API. Get/Post/Put/Delete to localhost:3000/api/entries
